# Infobliss
Through pigeonesis we have shown how people can stay connected with others life and also allowing others to be a part of their life. Various interesting features have been added along with a very important feature which is 'the blocking feature'. Through this website we have tried to help as many people as possible in such difficult times where all people fear is loneliness and isolation. In this project we tried to implement the things we got to learn during the Internet Web Programming class. We got a chance to put the learned knowledge into practice and gain a lot of practical knowledge. Also we explored a new language, Django. Overall, this project was a great additional learning bonus for us as developers, hope it adds value to your life as well.
